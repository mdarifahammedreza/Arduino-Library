# MAX7219-driven LED Dot Matrix Display

The [MAX7219](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/max7219-max7221.pdf) is "serial
input/output common-cathode display drivers that interface microprocessors (ÂµPs) to 7-segment numeric LED displays of up
to 8 digits, bar-graph displays, or 64 individual LEDs."
You can readily find MAX7219-driven
[8x8 LED matrices](https://www.google.com/search?q=max7219+led+matrix) for a couple of dollars online.
Unlike a 7-segment display, the mapping of bits to LEDs for this application is not defined in the datasheet, nor is
there an obvious orientation.
This library offers some customizations to accommodate your particular display module.

Another "gotcha" (and this really is beyond the scope of the library) is that the MAX7219 is strictly a 5V device (with
reasonable allowances), so if your microcontroller board outputs 3.3V for logic high then you will need a "level
converter" in your circuit.

## Discussion

### Configuring the Display

The library's options to configure the display are based on two assumptions:

- You have placed the display module such that one of the edges is "down"; that is, you have not positioned it
  diagonally
- The mapping of MAX7219 addresses to rows or columns is strictly sequential, and the mapping of a data byte's bits to
  LEDs is strictly sequential within each row or column

With those two assumptions, some combination of orientations (`EAST`, `NORTH`, `WEST`, or `SOUTH`) and of character
flips (`HEADS` or `TAILS`) will produce correct-looking text on your display.

In C++, use the `cowpi_configure_led_matrix_display(_words_per_minute_, _display_orientation_, _character_flip_)`
function to generate the appropriate `cowpi_display_module_t` variable.
In C, use
`(cowpi_display_module_t) {.display_module = LED_MATRIX, .words_per_minute = _words_per_minute_, .display_orientation = _display_orientation_, .character_flip = _character_flip_}`.
The scroll rate is expressed as an approximate number of words per minute that should pass along the display.
If you omit the display orientation and character flip, the default values of `EAST` and `HEADS` will be assumed;
however, there is only one chance in eight that this is correct.

### Font

The dot matrix font this library uses is nominally a 5x7 font, with the eighth row available for descenders.
Most characters occupy five columns, though some occupy fewer.
For this particular display module, the characters are placed in the scroll with a proportional spacing:
there is always exactly one blank column between characters (except when your string has explicit spacing.)

### Literal Bytes

The FILE stream for an LED matrix display supports sending literal bytes to the scroll to be displayed.
When the library finds `\x1B` (ASCII `ESC`, gcc `\e`), then the next byte (and only the next byte) will be sent as a
column encoding.
The most-significant bit is the LED in the bottom row, and the least-significant bit is the LED in the top row.
An intercharacter space is *not* automatically added after the literal byte, as the typical usage would be a series of
literal bytes (each preceded by `\x1B` or `\e`).
After you have finished with your custom character, you can add an intercharacter space by sending a literal `0x00` byte
to the display through the use of a conversion specifier (`"\x1B%c", 0x00`) -- if you include `\x00` in the format
string, then `fprintf` will interpret it as a terminating `NUL`.

### Communication Protocol

The MAX7219 natively supports SPI.
(Technically, there is a small deviation, but not one that you'll notice.)
At a minimum, you need to specify the pin used to indicate which peripheral should latch the data in.
In C++, use the `cowpi_configure_spi(_select_pin_)` function to generate the
appropriate `cowpi_display_module_protocol_t` variable.
In C, use `(cowpi_display_module_protocol_t) {.protocol = SPI, .select_pin = _select_pin_}`.
By default, the data pin and the clock pin are those used by the SPI hardware, even if you use the library's bit-banged
SPI implementation.
If you wish to use other pins, then specify them with `cowpi_configure_spi(_select_pin_, _data_pin_, _clock_pin_)` in
C++, or
`(cowpi_display_module_protocol_t) {.protocol = SPI, .data_pin = _data_pin_, .clock_pin = _clock_pin_, .select_pin = _select_pin_}`
in C.

## Example

### max7219_dotmatrix

The *max7219_dotmatrix* example demonstrates sending both text and literal bytes to the display module.

```c++
FILE *display;

void setup(void) {
    // The C++ approach
    display = cowpi_add_display_module(
            cowpi_configure_led_matrix_display(25, SOUTH, HEADS),
            cowpi_configure_spi(SS, MOSI, SCK)
    );

    // The C approach
    /*
    display = cowpi_add_display_module(
            (cowpi_display_module_t) {
                    .display_module = LED_MATRIX,
                    .words_per_minute = 25,
                    .display_orientation = SOUTH,
                    .character_flip = HEADS
            },
            (cowpi_display_module_protocol_t) {
                    .protocol = SPI,
                    .data_pin = MOSI,
                    .clock_pin = SCK,
                    .select_pin = SS
            }
    );
    */
}

void loop(void) {
    // On AVR architectures, you can use `fprintf_P` with `PSTR` to put the
    // format string in flash memory, if you want to
#ifdef __AVR__
    fprintf_P(display, PSTR("Hello, World!\t\e\x08\e\x3C\e\xEB\e\xC2\e\xEB\e\x3C\e\x08\t"));
#else
    fprintf(no_scroll_display, "Hello, World!\t\e\x08\e\x3C\e\xEB\e\xC2\e\xEB\e\x3C\e\x08\t");
#endif //__AVR__
    // Those literal bytes kind of looked like a cow face, right?
    // (awkward silence)
    // *Right*?
    fprintf(display, "Hello, World!\n");
}
