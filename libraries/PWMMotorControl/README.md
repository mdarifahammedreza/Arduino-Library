- The PWMDcMotor.cpp controls **brushed DC motors** by PWM using standard full bridge IC's like **[L298](https://www.instructables.com/L298-DC-Motor-Driver-DemosTutorial/)**, [**SparkFun Motor Driver - Dual TB6612FNG**](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14451), or **[Adafruit_MotorShield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438)** (using PCA9685 -> 2 x TB6612).
- The EncoderMotor.cpp.cpp controls a DC motor with attached encoder disc and slot-type photo interrupters to enable **driving a specified distance**.
- The CarPWMMotorControl.cpp controls **2 motors simultaneously** like it is required for most **Robot Cars**.
- To **compensate for different motor characteristics**, each motor can have a **positive** compensation value, which is **subtracted** from the requested speed PWM if you use the `setSpeedPWMCompensation()` functions. For car control, only compensation of one motor is required.

#### The motor is mainly controlled by 2 dimensions:
1. **Direction** / motor driver control. Can be FORWARD, BACKWARD, BRAKE (motor connections are shortened) or RELEASE (motor connections are high impedance).
2. **SpeedPWM** which is ignored for BRAKE or RELEASE. Some functions allow a signed speedPWM parameter, which includes the direction as sign (positive -> FORWARD).

#### Basic commands are:
- `init(uint8_t aForwardPin, uint8_t aBackwardPin, uint8_t aPWMPin)`.
- `setDirection(uint8_t aMotorDirection)`.
- `setSpeedPWM(uint8_t aSpeedPWM)`.
- `setSpeedPWMAndDirection(uint8_t aRequestedSpeedPWM, uint8_t aRequestedDirection)` or `setSpeedPWMAndDirection(int Signed_RequestedSpeedPWM)`.
- `stop()` or `setSpeedPWMAndDirection(0)`.
- `startRampUp(uint8_t aRequestedDirection)`.
- `getSpeed()`, `getAverageSpeed()`,  `getDistanceMillimeter()` and `getBrakingDistanceMillimeter()` for **encoder motors or MPU6050 IMU** equipped cars.

#### Functions to go a specified distance:
Driving speed PWM (2.0 V) is the PWM value to use for driving a fixed distance. If it is set higher than `RAMP_VALUE_OFFSET_SPEED_PWM` (2.3 V), the software generates a ramp up from `RAMP_VALUE_OFFSET_SPEED_PWM` to requested driving speed PWM at the start of the movement and a ramp down to stop.
- `goDistanceMillimeter(uint8_t aRequestedSpeedPWM, unsigned int aRequestedDistanceMillimeter, uint8_t aRequestedDirection);`<br/>
For **non encoder motors, distance and drive speed PWM is used in a formula to convert millimeters into motor driving time**.
- `updateMotor()` - call this in your loop if you use the start* functions e.g. `startGoDistanceMillimeter(int aRequestedDistanceMillimeter)`.

#### Functions for cars controlling 2 motors / motor sets from CarPWMMotorControl.hpp.
- `rotate(int aRotationDegrees, turn_direction_t aTurnDirection, bool aUseSlowSpeed, void (*aLoopCallback)(void))`.
- All other functions from above, but they are working now on both motors.

# Full bridges
This library was tested with the bipolar full bridge IC L298 and the MOSFET IC TB6612.

| The L298 has a loss of around 2 volt, which is the reason for the attached heat sink | The TB6612 has almost no loss |

# PWM period
- PWM period is 600 µs (1.6 kHz) for Adafruit Motor Shield V2 using PCA9685.
- PWM period is 1030 µs (970 Hz) for AnalogWrite on pin 5 + 6.

# [Examples](tree/master/examples)
## Start
One motor starts with DriveSpeedPWM / 2 for one second, then runs 1 second with DriveSpeedPWM.
After stopping the motor, it tries to run for one full rotation (resulting in a 90 degree turn for a 2WD car). Then the other motor runs the same cycle.
For the next loop, the direction is switched to backwards.

## Square
4 times drive 40 cm and 90 degree left turn. After the square, the car is turned by 180 degree and the direction is switched to backwards. Then the square starts again.

## PrintMotorDiagram
Prints **PWM, speed and distance** diagram of an encoder motor. The encoder increment is inverted at falling PWM slope to show the quadratic kind of encoder graph.

| Here you see that the speed is proportional to the PWM, but the minimal power to start the motor is 33/255 = 13% PWM or 0.9 volt. | Due to losses and other effects in the L298, the start voltage is much higher. |

## TestMotorWithIMU
Prints **PWM, speed and distance** diagram of the right (encoder) motor of a car equipped with a MPU6050 IMU.
Encoder and IMU (MPU6050) data are printed simultaneously, to compare and to detect slipping.<br/>
It does a start and stop car first with and second without ramp.
It starts with `DEFAULT_DRIVE_SPEED_PWM` and doubles speed for next turn until `MAX_SPEED_PWM`.

## RobotCarBasic
Template for your RobotCar control. Currently implemented is: Drive until distance too low, then stop, go backwards and turn random amount.

## BasicIRControl
Implements basic car control by an IR remote. Mapping between keys of any IR remote sending NEC protocol (all the cheap china ones) and car commands can be done in IRCommandMapping.h.<br/>
To support mapping, the received IR code is printed at the serial output if `INFO` is defined.

## SmartCarFollowerSimple
The car tries to hold a distance between 30 and 40 cm to an obstacle. Only forward and back movement, no turn!
The measured distance range is converted to a pitch as an acoustic feedback.

## SmartCarFollower
The car tries to hold a distance between 30 and 40 cm to an target. 
If the target vanishes, the distance sensor scans to get the vanished (or a new) target.

## [RobotCarBlueDisplay](https://github.com/ArminJo/Arduino-RobotCar)
Enables autonomous driving of a 2 or 4 wheel car with an Arduino.<br/>
To avoid obstacles a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor mounted on a SG90 Servo continuously scans the environment.
Manual control is implemented by a GUI using a Bluetooth HC-05 Module and the BlueDisplay library.

# Compile options / macros for this library

These macros must be defined in your program before the line `#include <CarPWMMotorControl.hpp>`, `#include <EncoderMotor.hpp>` or `#include <PWMDcMotor.hpp>`to take effect.<br/>
Modify them by enabling / disabling them, or change the values if applicable.
