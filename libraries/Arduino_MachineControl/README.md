Arduino Library for the Portenta Machine Control

The Portenta Machine Control enhances existing products with minimal effort, allowing companies to implement a standard platform across different equipment models. It is now easy to create an infrastructure of interconnected machines, which can be controlled onsite or via the cloud when needed; moreover, human-machine interaction can be further enahnced via mobile apps thanks to BLE connectivity.
